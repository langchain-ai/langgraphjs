fix(sdk): cancel runs on stop by default and add disconnect()

`stream.stop()` now calls `client.runs.cancel` for the active run before disconnecting the client (default `{ cancel: true }`). Join/rejoin UIs can call `stream.disconnect()` or `stop({ cancel: false })` to leave the agent running server-side.

This fills a missing gap we found when migrating to v1.
