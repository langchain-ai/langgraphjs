    "# How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application (functional API)\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info \"Prerequisites\"\n",
    "    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Multi-agent systems](../../concepts/multi_agent)\n",
    "    - [Human-in-the-loop](../../concepts/human_in_the_loop)\n",
    "    - [Functional API](../../concepts/functional_api)\n",
    "    - [Command](../../concepts/low_level/#command)\n",
    "    - [LangGraph Glossary](../../concepts/low_level/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this how-to guide, we’ll build an application that allows an end-user to engage in a *multi-turn conversation* with one or more agents. We'll create a node that uses an [`interrupt`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.interrupt-1.html) to collect user input and routes back to the **active** agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents will be implemented as tasks in a workflow that executes agent steps and determines the next action:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wait for user input** to continue the conversation, or\n",
    "2. **Route to another agent** (or back to itself, such as in a loop) via a [**handoff**](../../concepts/multi_agent/#handoffs).\n",

    "!!! note Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "    This guide requires `@langchain/langgraph>=0.2.42` and `@langchain/core>=0.3.36`."
