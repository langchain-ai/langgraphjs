    "# How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! info \"Prerequisites\"\n",
    "    This guide assumes familiarity with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Node](/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/#nodes)\n",
    "    - [Command](/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/#command)\n",
    "    - [Multi-agent systems](/langgraphjs/concepts/multi_agent)\n",
    "    - [Human-in-the-loop](/langgraphjs/concepts/human_in_the_loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this how-to guide, we’ll build an application that allows an end-user to engage in a *multi-turn conversation* with one or more agents. We'll create a node that uses an [`interrupt`](/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.interrupt-1.html) to collect user input and routes back to the **active** agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents will be implemented as nodes in a graph that executes agent steps and determines the next action:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wait for user input** to continue the conversation, or  \n",
    "2. **Route to another agent** (or back to itself, such as in a loop) via a [**handoff**](/langgraphjs/concepts/multi_agent/#handoffs).\n",

    "## Travel Recommendations Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will build a team of travel assistant agents that can communicate with each other via handoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create 3 agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `travelAdvisor`: can help with general travel destination recommendations. Can ask `sightseeingAdvisor` and `hotelAdvisor` for help.\n",
    "* `sightseeingAdvisor`: can help with sightseeing recommendations. Can ask `travelAdvisor` and `hotelAdvisor` for help.\n",
    "* `hotelAdvisor`: can help with hotel recommendations. Can ask `sightseeingAdvisor` and `hotelAdvisor` for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fully-connected network - every agent can talk to any other agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the handoffs between the agents we'll be using LLMs with structured output. Each agent's LLM will return an output with both its text response (`response`) as well as which agent to route to next (`goto`). If the agent has enough information to respond to the user, the `goto` will be set to `human` to route back and collect information from a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's define our agent nodes and graph!"
