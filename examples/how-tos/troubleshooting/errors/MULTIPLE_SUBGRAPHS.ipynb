    "- If you don't need to interrupt/resume from a subgraph, pass `checkpointer=false` when compiling it like this: `.compile({ checkpointer: false })`\n",
    "- Don't imperatively call graphs multiple times in the same node, and instead use the [`Send`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Send.html) API.\n"
