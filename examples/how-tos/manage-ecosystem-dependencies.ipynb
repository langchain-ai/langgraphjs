    "LangGraph.js is part of the [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/) ecosystem, which includes the primary [`langchain`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langchain) package as well as packages that contain integrations with individual third-party providers. They can be as specific as [`@langchain/anthropic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/anthropic), which contains integrations just for Anthropic chat models, or as broad as [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community), which contains broader variety of community contributed integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages, as well as LangGraph.js itself, all depend on [`@langchain/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core), which contains the base abstractions that these packages extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that all integrations and their types interact with each other properly, it is important that they all use the same version of `@langchain/core`. The best way to guarantee this is to add a `\"resolutions\"` or `\"overrides\"` field like the following in your project's `package.json`. The specific field name will depend on your package manager. Here are a few examples:\n",
