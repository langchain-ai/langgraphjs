    "# Reasoning without Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323), Xu, et. al, propose an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. (_ReACT-style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step_)\n",
    "2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram outlines ReWOO's overall computation graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReWoo Diagram](./img/rewoo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "ReWOO is made of 3 modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ðŸ§ **Planner**: Generate the plan in the following format:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E1 = Tool[argument for tool]\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E2 = Tool[argument for tool with #E1 variable substitution]\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Worker**: executes the tool with the provided arguments.\n",
    "4. ðŸ§ **Solver**: generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules with a ðŸ§  emoji depend on an LLM call. Notice that we avoid redundant calls to the planner LLM by using variable substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each module is represented by a LangGraph node. The end result will leave a trace that looks [like this one](https://smith.langchain.com/public/39dbdcf8-fbcc-4479-8e28-15377ca5e653/r). Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will provide the agent with a Tavily search engine tool. You can get an API key [here](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in) or replace with a free tool option (e.g., [duck duck go search](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on implementing ReWOO! Before you leave, I'll leave you with a couple limitations of the current implementation from the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If little context of the environment is available, the planner will be ineffective in its tool use. This can typically be ameliorated through few-shot prompting and/or fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. The tasks are still executed in sequence, meaning the total execution time is impacted by _every_ tool call, not just he longest-running in a given step."
