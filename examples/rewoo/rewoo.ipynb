    "# Reasoning without Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323), Xu, et. al, propose an agent that\n",
    "combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use.\n",
    "It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the\n",
    "following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of\n",
    "   tools used in a single pass. (_ReACT-style agent architecture requires many\n",
    "   LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps\n",
    "   are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step_)\n",
    "2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on\n",
    "   the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking\n",
    "   the tools (in theory).\n",

    "```text\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E1 = Tool[argument for tool]\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E2 = Tool[argument for tool with #E1 variable substitution]\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worker**: executes the tool with the provided arguments.\n",
    "4. 🧠**Solver**: generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool\n",
    "   observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules with a 🧠 emoji depend on an LLM call. Notice that we avoid\n",
