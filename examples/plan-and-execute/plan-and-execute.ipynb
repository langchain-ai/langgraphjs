    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a \"plan-and-execute\" style agent. This is\n",
    "heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper\n",
    "as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through\n",
    "that plan one item at a time. After accomplishing a particular task, you can\n",
    "then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent\n",
    "where you think one step at a time. The advantages of this \"plan-and-execute\"\n",
    "style agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)\n",
    "2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using\n",
    "   larger/better models for the planning step\n"
