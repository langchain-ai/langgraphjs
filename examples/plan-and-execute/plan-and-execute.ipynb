    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a \"plan-and-execute\" style agent. This is\n",
    "heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper\n",
    "as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through\n",
    "that plan one item at a time. After accomplishing a particular task, you can\n",
    "then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent\n",
    "where you think one step at a time. The advantages of this \"plan-and-execute\"\n",
    "style agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)\n",
    "2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using\n",
    "   larger/better models for the planning step\n"

After making birdie on No. 1 to momentarily pull even with the leaders, McIlroy was unable to take advantage of the short par-4 6th before leaving one on the table on the par-5 8th when his birdie putt from less than four feet failed to even touch the hole.\\\\n The shot on 14 was kind of the shot of the week for me -- to make a birdie there and grind it on the way in. The Champion Golfer of the Year now goes to defend the Claret Jug at Hoylake where he will relish the opportunity to put his creativity and imagination on display again.\\\\n Instead, the City of Angels saw a breakout performance from perhaps one of the game's rising stars as 29-year-old Wyndham Clark (-10) outlasted the veteran McIlroy (-9) to capture his first major championship and clinch his second professional victory.\\\\n\\\",\\\"score\\\":0.9956685,\\\"raw_content\\\":null},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"U.S. Open 2023 Golf Leaderboard - PGA TOUR\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/2023/u.s-open/R2023026\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"PGA TOUR Live Leaderboard 2023 U.S. Open, Los Angeles - Golf Scores and Results. ...
