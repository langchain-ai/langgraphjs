# Human-in-the-loop

!!! tip "This guide uses the new `interrupt` function."

    As of LangGraph 0.2.31, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] as it simplifies **human-in-the-loop** patterns.

    If you're looking for the previous version of this conceptual guide, which relied on static breakpoints and `NodeInterrupt` exception, it is available [here](v0-human-in-the-loop.md). 

A **human-in-the-loop** (or "on-the-loop") workflow integrates human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions, validation, or corrections at key stages. This is especially useful in **LLM-based applications**, where the underlying model may generate occasional inaccuracies. In low-error-tolerance scenarios like compliance, decision-making, or content generation, human involvement ensures reliability by enabling review, correction, or override of model outputs.

## Use cases

Key use cases for **human-in-the-loop** workflows in LLM-based applications include:

1. [**üõ†Ô∏è Reviewing tool calls**](#review-tool-calls): Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.

2. **‚úÖ Validating LLM outputs**: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.

3. **üí° Providing context**: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.

## `interrupt`

The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] in LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop workflows by pausing the graph at a specific node, presenting information to a human, and resuming the graph with their input. This function is useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or collecting additional input. The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] is used in conjunction with the [`Command`](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) object to resume the graph with a value provided by the human.

```typescript
import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { type State } from "./types";

function humanNode(state: State) {
  const value = interrupt(
    // Any JSON serializable value to surface to the human.
    // For example, a question or a piece of text or a set of keys in the state
    someData
  );

  // Update the state with the human's input or route the graph based on the input.
  // ...
}

const graph = graphBuilder.compile({
  checkpointer // Required for `interrupt` to work
});

// Run the graph until the interrupt
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: "some_id" } };
await graph.invoke(someInput, { config: threadConfig });
    
// Resume the graph with the human's input
await graph.invoke(Command.resume(valueFromHuman), { config: threadConfig });
```

## Requirements

To use `interrupt` in your graph, you need to:

1. [**Specify a checkpointer**](persistence.md#checkpoints) to save the graph state after each step.

2. **Call `interrupt()`** in the appropriate place. See the [Design Patterns](#design-patterns) section for examples.

3. **Run the graph** with a [**thread ID**](./persistence.md#threads) until the `interrupt` is hit.

4. **Resume execution** using `invoke`/`stream` (see [**The `Command` primitive**](#the-command-primitive)).

## Design Patterns

There are typically three different **actions** that you can do with a human-in-the-loop workflow:

1. **Approve or Reject**: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involve **routing** the graph based on the human's input.

2. **Edit Graph State**: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves **updating** the state with the human's input.

3. **Get Input**: Explicitly request human input at a particular step in the graph. This is useful for collecting additional information or context to inform the agent's decision-making process or for supporting **multi-turn conversations**.

Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using these **actions**.

### Approve or Reject

<figcaption>Depending on the human's approval or rejection, the graph can proceed with the action or take an alternative path.</figcaption>

</figure>

Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action.

```typescript
import { type State } from "./types";
import { interrupt, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

function humanApproval(state: State): Command<"some_node" | "another_node"> {
  const isApproved = interrupt({
    question: "Is this correct?",
    // Surface the output that should be
    // reviewed and approved by the human.
    llm_output: state.llm_output
  });

  if (isApproved) {
    return Command.goto("some_node");
  } else {
    return Command.goto("another_node");
  }
}

// Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
// and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graphBuilder.addNode("human_approval", humanApproval);

const graph = graphBuilder.compile({ checkpointer });

// After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
// Resume it with either an approval or rejection.
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: "some_id" } };
await graph.invoke(Command.resume(true), { config: threadConfig });
```

    task: "Review the output from the LLM and make any necessary edits.",
    llm_generated_summary: state.llm_generated_summary
  });

  // Update the state with the edited text
  return {
    llm_generated_summary: result.edited_text
  };
}

// Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
// and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graphBuilder.addNode("human_editing", humanEditing);

const graph = graphBuilder.compile({ checkpointer });

// After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
// Resume it with the edited text.
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: "some_id" } };
await graph.invoke(
  Command.resume({ edited_text: "The edited text" }), 
  { config: threadConfig }
);
```

  const humanReview = interrupt({
    question: "Is this correct?",
    // Surface tool calls for review
    tool_call: toolCall
  });

  const [reviewAction, reviewData] = humanReview;

  // Approve the tool call and continue
  if (reviewAction === "continue") {
    return Command.goto("run_tool");
  }
  // Modify the tool call manually and then continue
  else if (reviewAction === "update") {
    const updatedMsg = getUpdatedMsg(reviewData);
    // Remember that to modify an existing message you will need
    // to pass the message with a matching ID.
    return Command.goto("run_tool").update({ messages: [updatedMessage] });
  }
  // Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent
  else if (reviewAction === "feedback") {
    const feedbackMsg = getFeedbackMsg(reviewData);
    return Command.goto("call_llm").update({ messages: [feedbackMsg] });
  }
}
```

### Multi-turn conversation

<figure markdown="1">

![image](img/human_in_the_loop/multi-turn-conversation.png){: style="max-height:400px"}

<figcaption>A <strong>multi-turn conversation</strong> architecture where an <strong>agent</strong> and <strong>human node</strong> cycle back and forth until the agent decides to hand off the conversation to another agent or another part of the system.

</figcaption>

</figure>

A **multi-turn conversation** involves multiple back-and-forth interactions between an agent and a human, which can allow the agent to gather additional information from the human in a conversational manner.

This design pattern is useful in an LLM application consisting of [multiple agents](./multi_agent.md). One or more agents may need to carry out multi-turn conversations with a human, where the human provides input or feedback at different stages of the conversation. For simplicity, the agent implementation below is illustrated as a single node, but in reality it may be part of a larger graph consisting of multiple nodes and include a conditional edge.

=== "Using a human node per agent"

    In this pattern, each agent has its own human node for collecting user input. 

    This can be achieved by either naming the human nodes with unique names (e.g., "human for agent 1", "human for agent 2") or by
    using subgraphs where a subgraph contains a human node and an agent node.

    ```typescript
    import { type State } from "./types";
    import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    function humanInput(state: State) {
      const humanMessage = interrupt("human_input");

      return {
        messages: [
          {
            role: "human",
            content: humanMessage
          }
        ]
      };
    }

    function agent(state: State) {
      // Agent logic
      // ...
    }

    graphBuilder.addNode("human_input", humanInput);
    graphBuilder.addEdge("human_input", "agent");

    const graph = graphBuilder.compile({ checkpointer });

    // After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
    // Resume it with the human's input.
    await graph.invoke(
      Command.resume("hello!"),
      { config: threadConfig }
    );
    ```

=== "Sharing human node across multiple agents"

    In this pattern, a single human node is used to collect user input for multiple agents. The active agent is determined from the state, so after human input is collected, the graph can route to the correct agent.

    ```typescript
    import { type MessagesState } from "./types";
    import { interrupt, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    function humanNode(state: MessagesState): Command<"agent_1" | "agent_2"> {
      /**
       * A node for collecting user input.
       */
      const userInput = interrupt("Ready for user input.");

      // Determine the **active agent** from the state, so 
      // we can route to the correct agent after collecting input.
      // For example, add a field to the state or use the last active agent.
      // or fill in `name` attribute of AI messages generated by the agents.
      const activeAgent = ...; 

      return Command.goto(activeAgent).update({
        messages: [{
          role: "human",
          content: userInput,
        }]
      });
    }
    ```

See [how to implement multi-turn conversations](../how-tos/multi-agent-multi-turn-convo.ipynb) for a more detailed example.

### Validating human input

If you need to validate the input provided by the human within the graph itself (rather than on the client side), you can achieve this by using multiple interrupt calls within a single node.

```typescript
import { type State } from "./types";
import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

function humanNode(state: State) {
  /**
   * Human node with validation.
   */
  let question = "What is your age?";

  while (true) {
    const answer = interrupt(question);

    // Validate answer, if the answer isn't valid ask for input again.
    if (typeof answer !== "number" || answer < 0) {
      question = `'${answer}' is not a valid age. What is your age?`;
      continue;
    } else {
      // If the answer is valid, we can proceed.
      break;
    }
  }
            
  console.log(`The human in the loop is ${answer} years old.`);

  return {
    age: answer
  };
}
```

## The `Command` primitive

When using the `interrupt` function, the graph will pause at the interrupt and wait for user input.

Graph execution can be resumed using the [Command](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) primitive which can be passed through the `invoke` or `stream` methods.

The `Command` primitive provides several options to control and modify the graph's state during resumption:

1. **Pass a value to the `interrupt`**: Provide data, such as a user's response, to the graph using `Command.resume(value)`. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, however, this time the `interrupt(...)` call will return the value passed in the `Command.resume(value)` instead of pausing the graph.

       ```typescript
       // Resume graph execution with the user's input.
       await graph.invoke(Command.resume({ age: "25" }), { config: threadConfig });
       ```

2. **Update the graph state**: Modify the graph state using `Command.goto(...).update(update)`. Note that resumption starts from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, but with the updated state.

      ```typescript
      // Update the graph state and resume.
      // You must provide a `resume` value if using an `interrupt`.
      await graph.invoke(
        Command.resume("Let's go!!!").update({ foo: "bar" }), 
        { config: threadConfig }
      );
      ```

By leveraging `Command`, you can resume graph execution, handle user inputs, and dynamically adjust the graph's state.

## Using with `invoke`

When you use `stream` to run the graph, you will receive an `Interrupt` event that let you know the `interrupt` was triggered. 

`invoke` does not return the interrupt information. To access this information, you must use the [getState](../reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.graph.CompiledGraph.get_state) method to retrieve the graph state after calling `invoke`.

```typescript
// Run the graph up to the interrupt 
const result = await graph.invoke(inputs, { config: threadConfig });

// Get the graph state to get interrupt information.
const state = await graph.getState({ config: threadConfig });

// Print the state values
console.log(state.values);

// Print the pending tasks
console.log(state.tasks);

// Resume the graph with the user's input.
await graph.invoke(Command.resume({ age: "25" }), { config: threadConfig });
```

```typescript
{ foo: 'bar' } // State values

[
  {
    id: '5d8ffc92-8011-0c9b-8b59-9d3545b7e553',
    name: 'node_foo',
    path: ['__pregel_pull', 'node_foo'],
    error: null,
    interrupts: [{
      value: 'value_in_interrupt',
      resumable: true,
      ns: ['node_foo:5d8ffc92-8011-0c9b-8b59-9d3545b7e553'],
      when: 'during'
    }],
    state: null,
    result: null
  }
] // Pending tasks. interrupts 
```

## How does resuming from an interrupt work?

!!! warning

    Resuming from an `interrupt` is **different** from JavaScript's `prompt()` function, where execution resumes from the exact point where the `prompt()` function was called.

A critical aspect of using `interrupt` is understanding how resuming works. When you resume execution after an `interrupt`, graph execution starts from the **beginning** of the **graph node** where the last `interrupt` was triggered.

**All** code from the beginning of the node to the `interrupt` will be re-executed.

```typescript
let counter = 0;

function node(state: State) {
  // All the code from the beginning of the node to the interrupt will be re-executed
  // when the graph resumes.
  counter += 1;

  console.log(`> Entered the node: ${counter} # of times`);

  // Pause the graph and wait for user input.
  const answer = interrupt();

  console.log("The value of counter is:", counter);
  // ...
}
```

Upon **resuming** the graph, the counter will be incremented a second time, resulting in the following output:

```typescript
> Entered the node: 2 # of times
The value of counter is: 2
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Side-effects

Place code with side effects, such as API calls, **after** the `interrupt` to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. 

=== "Side effects before interrupt (BAD)"

    This code will re-execute the API call another time when the node is resumed from
    the `interrupt`.
    This can be problematic if the API call is not idempotent or is just expensive.

    ```typescript
    import { type State } from "./types";
    import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    function humanNode(state: State) {
      /**
       * Human node with validation.
       */
      apiCall(); // This code will be re-executed when the node is resumed.

      const answer = interrupt(question);
    }
    ```

=== "Side effects after interrupt (OK)"

    ```typescript
    import { type State } from "./types";
    import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    function humanNode(state: State) {
      /**
       * Human node with validation.
       */
        
      const answer = interrupt(question);
        
      apiCall(answer); // OK as it's after the interrupt
    }
    ```

=== "Side effects in a separate node (OK)"

    ```typescript
    import { type State } from "./types";
    import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    function humanNode(state: State) {
      /**
       * Human node with validation.
       */
        
      const answer = interrupt(question);
        
      return {
        answer
      };
    }

    function apiCallNode(state: State) {
      apiCall(); // OK as it's in a separate node
    }
    ```

### Subgraphs called as functions

**Subgraphs**: If you're invoking a subgraph [as a function](low_level.md#as-a-function), the **parent** graph will be re-run from the **beginning of the node** where the subgraph was invoked.

```typescript
function someNode(state: State) {
  someCode(); // <-- This code will be re-executed when the subgraph is resumed.

  // Using a subgraph as a function.
  // The subgraph has an `interrupt` call
  const subgraphResult = await subgraph.invoke(someInput);
  // ...
}
```

### Using multiple interrupts

Using multiple interrupts within a **single** node can be helpful for patterns like [validating human input](#validating-human-input). However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is **strictly index-based**, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical.

To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via `Command.resume(...).update(SOME_STATE_MUTATION)` or relying on global variables to modify the node's structure dynamically.
