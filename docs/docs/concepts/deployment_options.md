The guide below will explain the differences between the deployment options.

## Self-Hosted

!!! important

    The Self-Hosted version is only available for **a free trial** and **Enterprise** plan.

With a Self-Hosted deployment, you are responsible for managing the infrastructure, including setting up and maintaining required databases and Redis instances.

Youâ€™ll build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](./langgraph_cli.md), which can then be deployed on your own infrastructure.

## Cloud SaaS

!!! important

    The Cloud SaaS version of LangGraph Platform is only available for **Plus** and **Enterprise** plans.

The [Cloud SaaS](./langgraph_cloud.md) version of LangGraph Platform is hosted as part of [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

The Cloud SaaS version of LangGraph Platform provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph applications.

This deployment option provides an integration with GitHub, allowing you to deploy code from any of your repositories on GitHub.

## Bring Your Own Cloud

!!! important

    The Bring Your Own Cloud version of LangGraph Platform is only available for **Enterprise** plans.

This combines the best of both worlds for Cloud and Self-Hosted. We manage the infrastructure, so you don't have to, but the infrastructure all runs within your cloud. This is currently only available on AWS.
