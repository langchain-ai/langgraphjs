# Time Travel ‚è±Ô∏è

!!! note "Prerequisites"

    This guide assumes that you are familiar with LangGraph's checkpoints and states. If not, please review the [persistence](./persistence.md) concept first.

When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:

1. ü§î **Understand Reasoning**: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.

2. üêû **Debug Mistakes**: Identify where and why errors occurred.

3. üîç **Explore Alternatives**: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.

We call these debugging techniques **Time Travel**, composed of two key actions: [**Replaying**](#replaying) üîÅ and [**Forking**](#forking) üîÄ.

## Replaying

Replaying allows us to revisit and reproduce an agent's past actions. This can be done either from the current state (or checkpoint) of the graph or from a specific checkpoint.

To replay from the current state, simply pass `null` as the input along with a `threadConfig`:

```typescript
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: "1" }, streamMode: "values" };

for await (const event of await graph.stream(null, threadConfig)) {
    console.log(event);
}
```

To replay actions from a specific checkpoint, start by retrieving all checkpoints for the thread:

```typescript
const allCheckpoints = [];

for await (const state of graph.getStateHistory(threadConfig)) {
    allCheckpoints.push(state);
}
```

Each checkpoint has a unique ID. After identifying the desired checkpoint, for instance, `xyz`, include its ID in the configuration:

```typescript
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: '1', checkpoint_id: 'xyz' }, streamMode: "values" };

for await (const event of await graph.stream(null, threadConfig)) {
    console.log(event);
}
```

The graph efficiently replays previously executed nodes instead of re-executing them, leveraging its awareness of prior checkpoint executions.

## Forking

Forking allows you to revisit an agent's past actions and explore alternative paths within the graph.

To edit a specific checkpoint, such as `xyz`, provide its `checkpoint_id` when updating the graph's state:

```typescript
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: "1", checkpoint_id: "xyz" } };

graph.updateState(threadConfig, { state: "updated state" });
```

This creates a new forked checkpoint, xyz-fork, from which you can continue running the graph:

```typescript
const threadConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: '1', checkpoint_id: 'xyz-fork' }, streamMode: "values" };

for await (const event of await graph.stream(null, threadConfig)) {
    console.log(event);
}
```
