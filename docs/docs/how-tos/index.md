## Core

The core guides show how to address common needs when building a out AI workflows, with special focus placed on [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)-style agents with [tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/tool_calling/).

- [Persistence](persistence.ipynb): How to give your graph "memory" and resiliance by saving and loading state
- [Time travel](time-travel.ipynb): How to navigate and manipulate graph state history once it's persisted
- [Stream tokens](stream-tokens.ipynb): How to stream tokens and tool calls from your agent within a graph
- [Configuration](configuration.ipynb): How to indicate that a graph can swap out configurable components

### Design patterns

How to apply common design patterns in your workflows:

- [Branching](branching.ipynb): How to create branching logic in your graphs for parallel node execution
