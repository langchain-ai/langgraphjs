# Tutorials

Welcome to the LangGraph Tutorials! These notebooks introduce LangGraph through building various language agents and applications.

## Introduction to LangGraph

Learn the basics of LangGraph through the onboarding tutorials.

- [Introduction to LangGraph](introduction.ipynb)

## Use cases

Learn from example implementations of graphs designed for specific scenarios and that implement common design patterns.

- [Hierarchical Teams](multi_agent/hierarchical_agent_teams.ipynb): Orchestrating nested teams of agents to solve problems
- [Collaboration](multi_agent/multi_agent_collaboration.ipynb): Enabling two agents to collaborate on a task

#### RAG

- [Agentic RAG](rag/langgraph_agentic_rag.ipynb)
- [Corrective RAG](rag/langgraph_crag.ipynb)
- [Self-RAG](rag/langgraph_self_rag.ipynb)

#### Planning Agents

- [Plan-and-Execute](plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute.ipynb): Implementing a basic planning and execution agent

#### Reflection & Critique
